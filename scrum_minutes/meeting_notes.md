## Meeting 1 Minutes
### 10/28/2022
* Next.js is pretty powerful, seems like a good avenue for the frontend
  * Fairly complex, but still likely worth
* Flask is relatively easy, but requires migrating from Java
  * Considering Java Spring as backend solution instead, wouldn't require significant migration
* Sprint 1 MVP should be near identical to final product from Project 2, but web app
  * May need to move some portion over to Sprint 2 due to time constraints

## Meeting 2 Minutes
### 11/01/2022
* Java Spring sucks lol
  * Way less intuitive, minimizing any benefits from not needing to migrate
  * Gonna stick to Python Flask backend from here on out
* Next.js proving even trickier than expected
  * Annoyingly difficult to even get a project set up
  * React.js seems relatively okay, so holding out for Anthony to figure out the first step
* API creation is imminent and will necessitate documentation as well

## Meeting 3 Minutes
### 11/04/20222
* Database design is very bizarre and unintuitive, needs to be updated
* API documentation was created and is already worth its weight in gold
* Python backend coming along nicely
  * DB queries can be made, elements represented decently
* Frontend progress is slow and steady
  * Mostly just learning JS and Next at this point
* Backend and frontend need to be carefully linked through API calls
  * Further investigation into JS libraries to do so is needed
